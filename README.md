# ReactEditor [![Build Status](https://github.com/mike-han/react-editor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mike-han/react-editor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-editor-test.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-editor-test)  [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/react-editor-test.svg?maxAge=2592000)](http://www.npmtrends.com/react-editor-test)

A quill-based react component that controls the editor via custom plugins.

When using react and quill in combination, the ui of the toolbar provided by quill.js always can not meet my needs. This library will wrap quill into a react component and allow users to completely customize the ui of the toolbar in the form of a plugin. 

***Note: In the test release, there is only one empty component, do not download it yet***
